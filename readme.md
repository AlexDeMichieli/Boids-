# Project Title

Flocking.

Flocking is the behavior exhibited when a group of birds, called a flock, are foraging or in flight. This is a computer simulation that describes this behavior and is inspired by the work of Daniel Shiffman and the original algorithm created by Craig Reynolds in 1987.

## Getting Started

Use 'Npm start' to start. Use the sliders to play with alignment, separation and cohesion, which are the 3 main rules that, if added together, create flocking. Boids are also designed to avoid obscacles. Activate the obscacle with the GUI and place it inside the screen.

## Deployment

Deployed on Heroku at.

## Built With

P5.js and Javascript.
